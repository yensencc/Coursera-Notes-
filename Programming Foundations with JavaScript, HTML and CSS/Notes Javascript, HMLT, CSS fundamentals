7 steos approach to solving programming problems

1- Work a small Example by hand
- Solve samll instance by hand
- Unclear problem ?
- Need domain knowledge ?
2- Write Down what you did
- Write down exact steps
- Just that instance
- Tricky: do without thinking
3- Find patterns
- Algorithm for any instance
- Find patterns
- Repetition, conditions, values
- Difficulties ? try step 1 + 2 again
- Different input
4- Check By hand
- Incorrect pattern? Find now
- Check with different inputs
5- Translate to Code
- Translate algoritm into a programmin language
6- Run Text Cases
- Execute program
- Check answer
7- Debug Failed Test Cases
Test failed? Debug and try step 3
Implementation problem? try step 5
- Use scientific method
