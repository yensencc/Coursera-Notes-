So repeat after me:

Java is pass-by-value.

(OK, once again... with feeling.)

Java is pass-by-value.

For primitives, you pass a copy of the actual value.

For references to objects, you pass a copy of the reference (the remote control).

You never pass the object. All objects are stored on the heap. Always.

Now go have an extra big cup of coffee and write some code.
